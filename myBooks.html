			<p id="bookDesc1">
				Back in the year 1507, the Kingdom of Ekhelyra
				was ruled by King Yumi Shinobu -- a super homophobic
				king who will burn any gay person a the stake -- and
				his wife: Queen Mariah Shinobu. His 6 year old son,
				Naiomi, has gotten pretty used to royal life. He likes
				being able to ask for anything and get it. He is freely
				allowed to explore the kingdom, as it is not that big 
				and it's hard to get lost. Naiomi has a twin sister named
				Isabel. While everyone in the kingdom knows Naiomi, almost
				no one knows who she is. She doesn't care. She sees all of 
				the newspaper people interviewing Naiomi and realizes
				that she doesn't want anything to do with that.
